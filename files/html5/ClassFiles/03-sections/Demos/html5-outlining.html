        <h1>Apples</h1>

        <p>Why do you think the expression is the "<strong>apple</strong> of your eye" and not the zucchini of your eye.
            It's because apples are good and zucchinis aren't, that's why!.</p>

        <h2>Doctor Bias towards Veggies</h2>

        <p>An apple a day keeps the doctor away and we like going to the doctor almost as little as we like eating
            vegetables. But doctors want your business, that's why they often recommend eating vegetables...</p>

        <h1>Peaches</h1>

        <p>If someone tells you that you're a peach, that's a good thing right. But who wants to be told that they're a
            squash. Nobody.</p>

        <h1>Cherries</h1>

        <p>Remember the line from the musical Oklahoma in the song "I can't say No:"</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>S'posin' 'at he says 'at yer lips're "like cherries"</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Having lips like cherries is flattering, right? Would you like lips like eggplant? Of course, not. Cheeries =
            good. Eggplant = bad.</p>

        <h1>Vegetables to Avoid</h1>

        <p>Really you should avoid all veggies as they are likely to make your taste buds squirm, but there are a couple
            you should avoid at all costs.</p>

            <h1>Tomatoes are Traitors</h1>

            <p>Tomatoes are the Benedict of all "veggies" and should never be eaten.</p>

            <h2>The Benedict Arnold Fruit</h2>

            <p>Nobody likes at traitor...</p>

            <h2>Tomatoes can be useful</h2>

            <p>We're not saying never to buy tomatoes. Just don't eat them. They can be useful for other things, such as
                throwing at bad actors.
